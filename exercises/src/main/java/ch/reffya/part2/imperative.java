The goal of this exercise is to refresh the imperative programming concepts seen in the C language.
This covers data types, operations, if then else, switch, arrays, loop, etc...

The main method is already completed, you just have to fill the remaining method while following the provided
instructions.

Once you are done you can run the test file in test/java/ch/reffya/imperativeTests.java
